**My OpenGL Minecraft clone in c++**

I'm using this project to learn OpenGL programming.
Some of the code may look plagarized, because of how much
of a standard OpenGL is, it will usually look the same.
Also, people have attempted this same type of project before,
so there may be accidental crossover. My code shouldn't be
copying others verbatim, but it's not impossible for similarities.

Any code that was directly copied and pasted will be labeled with a comment that starts with `// COPY:`

You must have [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed to run this.

To run:

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Todolist

- [ ] Texture atlas
  - [ ] Side Atlas
